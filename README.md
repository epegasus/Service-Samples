### DATE: 17-JAN-2023

#### Defination:
    -> A Service is an `application component` that can perform long-running operations in the background. 
    -> Additionally, a component can bind to a service to interact with it and even perform interprocess communication (IPC). 
    
    Inter-Process Communication or IPC in short, is a mechanism that allows multiple independent processes to communicate and exchange data.

#### Examples:
	1) Network Transactions
	2) Play Music
	3) Perform I/O operations
	4) Interact with content providers

#### NOTE:	
	Service runs on 'Main Thread', avoid thread-blocking operations else it will produce ANR's.

### ANRs
	ANR's are a problem because the app's main thread, can't process user input events or draw.
	-> Input dispatching timed out:
			* 5-sec time out
	-> Executing service
			* If a service declared by your app cannot finish executing Service.onCreate() 
	   		  and Service.onStartCommand()/Service.onBind() within a few seconds.
	-> Service.startForeground() not called
			* If your app uses Context.startForegroundService() to start a new service in the foreground, 
			  but the service then does not call startForeground() within 5 seconds.
	-> Broadcast of intent
			* If a BroadcastReceiver hasn't finished executing within a set amount of time.
			  If the app has any activity in the foreground, this timeout is 5 seconds.
			  
### Enable background ANR dialogs
	Android shows ANR dialogs for apps that take too long to process the broadcast message only 
	if Show all ANRs is enabled in the deviceâ€™s Developer options. For this reason, background ANR 
	dialogs are not always displayed to the user, but the app could still be experiencing performance issues.
	
	
### Types of Services
	-> Foreground Service	(Noticeable to the user) e.g. Audio Player
	-> Background Service	(Hidden) e.g. Cleaning Storage
	-> Bound Service 		(Binded with an application component)
	
	Bound service can be binded with multiple components. It will automatically be get killed when all components unbind it.
	A bound service runs only as long as another application component is bound to it.
	
#### Choosing b/w thread or service?	
	
#### NOTE (Work Manager)
	In many cases, using WorkManager is preferable to using foreground services directly.	
	
### Steps
 
#### Step # 1
	Add <service> tag in Manifest
	
	```
	<manifest ... >
  		...
 	 	<application ... >
			<service android:name=".ExampleService" />
			...
		</application>
	</manifest>
	```
 
#### Step # 2
	Extend class with Service
	
	```
	class HelloService : Service() {
		...
	}
	```
	
 	1) onStartCommand()
	2) onBind()
	3) onCreate()
	4) onDestroy()
